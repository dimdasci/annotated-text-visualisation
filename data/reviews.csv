We would definitely stay again on our next visit to Larnaca. Thank you so much for the great time we had with you. "
"Positive: We wanted a hotel for a night that is close to the airport and this hotel did that purpose more than fair. There are some restaurants and bars next to the beach just 10min of walking distance from the hotel. Negative: The receptionist didn't speak English properly, and you have a feeling that people are living in the hotel, rather than staying at a hotel. You can hear the airplanes coming and leaving from the airport all the time, so if you are sensitive to the sounds around you and at night, better to skip this hotel and choose a different one."
"Positive: Second visit - Chose really because it was reasonably close to the Airport for an early morning flight, yet could have a stroll along the nearby beach. The staff make it - particularly reception and the dining room.

"Positive: The hotel is impressive how clean nice and comfortable it is, however what will bring me back is the staff and the owners.  Richard (the chef) is personally buying super fresh food for the restaurant.  Everything from breakfast to dinner is absolutely delicious. The owners have been super kind to me :). "
"Positive: Room was perfect, looked new, clean shiny tiled floors and bathroom tiles, just every inch perfect and clean. Bed was really comfortable, lots of room for me to put my things. although might have needed another set of drawers if there were two of us. Negative: Fridge could have been put on beforehand so it was cold, the shower took a while to get hot, had to have a cold shower one morning as i needed to get out early. When you left it running for around 5 mins it got warm and was a good shower. Ordered pizza one night and was not great, too stodgy but I'm sure other food is better. The restaurant area is nice and the staff very accomodating."

The receptionist on check in was very good and explained the information very clearly to us. The room was smaller than I expected but as we were only there a few days it was acceptable. I am very fussy about beds and pillows, but I had no problem as they were very clean, and the bed was really comfortable.

"Positive: Super friendly and helpful staff. A good location 5 lins away from the airport by car, 5 mins walk to the beach. Clean modern rooms, very nice breakfast. Negative: It is typical of all restaurants in the area - the kitchen shuts at 22:30 or so, and there is no food to be had afterwards. I would just flag that ahead of time in the welcome email to those arriving from the UK (most early afternoon flights land after 23:00) and have something like nuts / chips available to buy on arrival."
Positive: hospitality. Negative: clean.
Positive: clean spacious practical. 
"Positive: The facilities were really good, particularly for the tariff charged. Was met with a warm welcome at reception and then again by the dining staff. Negative: Outside was a but noisy later in the evening, but that's not within the hotels control."

"Positive: Perfect place to stay for early morning / late night flights as it‚Äôs situated within 5 minutes from the airport. . beds are extremely comfortable and amazing hospitality from the staff. Negative: given that a lot of guests book here for its prime location near the airport, it would‚Äôve been great if breakfast started at 7 rather than 8. but that‚Äôs just a suggestion, everything was perfect. for one nights stay."
"Positive: Very clean, very comfortable room. Staff was extremely helpful. They ordered a taxi for us to get to the airport very early in the morning.

Positive: It‚Äôs been renovated to a exceptionally high standard and it really is well up to 4* standard. Exceptional value . Negative: I cannot find a single negative point‚Ä¶which is unusual. Having spent 45 years travelling as part of work I am perhaps over critical.
"Positive: We were looking for the hotel close to the airport, and it was a perfect match. The hotel is located in a close proximity to the airport (5 min by car or 10 min by bus). We arrived late and were super hungry, so we decided to eat in the place at the ground floor. Even though the kitchen was closing, they made us a pizza which was really nice. The room was new and clean, the staff reached out in advance and provided us with the detailed instructions of how to get to the room when reception closes.

Perfect for our short stay and the hotel was immaculately clean. I was particularly impressed when the staff emailed me via booking.com and after asking me what time I was arriving (the hotel is not manned 24/7 but arrangements are made to collect your room key in the hotel if you are arriving outside of normal hours), told me which bus routes I needed to take.

Negative: Taxi drivers who cooperate with hotel, both times, from airport and back, charged 2-3 EUR above the price agreed with the hotel (20 EUR). To clarify, it is not about the money, I would certainly give that money as a tip, but feeling that someone is cheating you and stilling money from you is really awkward and ugly, especially when you are alone with small child in the middle of the night and have no alternative way of transport."

Negative: 1. The mattresses were hard. 2. When we were booking the room there was a promotion from booking.com which didn't apply and we payed 80 euro more. After that I checked a new dates to book and we had similar number and if we do it it will be the same. This is a big fraud.

The room was clean and an adequate size with a nice balcony. Breakfast was outstanding. The staff were all friendly and welcoming - especially the restaurant owner.

"Positive: Excellent staff in this family driven hotel. Very helpful and pleasant people who speak perfect English and couldn't have been better -- all the way from the booking process and online dialog to putting us on a taxi to the airport! This alone is reason enough to come back :-). Rooms and hotel in general are very clean, aircon modern and quiet, and room service is also excellent. Plenty of electricity outlets in the room, also by the bed, but remember the UK-adapter to use standard EU-plugs ;-). The double bed, although nothing fancy, was probably the best hotel bed we've slept in . ever. Negative: Except excellent staff/owners and an ok restaurant, there is not much extra in this hotel or in the room. . Tips for improvement:. - The out-of-order pool table hidden away in the backyard should be brought back to life. - The backyard itself could actually have been used so much better. . - The small fridge in the room was warm (turned off) upon arrival and completely empty, and no local shop/kiosk nearby to fill it up. One small bottle of water upon arrival to double room feels a little poor. Would gladly have paid those 2‚Ç¨ more per day to have 2 bottles initially and being refilled daily with room service. A couple of cents more, to have even tea on the small welcome tray ;-). - Bathroom floor gets completely wet when (carefully) showering, as only half a glass wall covers the shower. . - Bed frame has very sharp/hard corners, and it's easy to get hurt. Apply baby safety corners. - Veranda door and main door doesn't close entirely tight so main door slams in the night when it's windy. However fixable in MacGyver way using the bed cover and a tea spoon, although a professional seal attached to the door frame would probably be a better fix long-term ;-). - Beach towel services would also have been nice and useful, to avoid using lots of space/weight in baggage. All in all, this hotel is great but still has room for improvement in many little details which could easily be fixed. Still getting our high rating as the staff is simply the best and made our stay a true pleasure, thus above comments should not scare anyone from booking this hotel. We highly recommend it and would definitely love to return."

Positive: close to the airport. Negative: stingy smell from the bathroom. quite small room.
Positive: Light and airy and clean room. Not far from the sea. Negative: There should be a safety strip on the step to each floor coming up the stairs. You are unaware of it and could possibly trip as I did.

We had both a family room and a double room, and they were perfect for our quick stay.  The taxi driver had a hard time finding it to drop us off, as it‚Äôs amongst several apartment buildings on a small side street.  That‚Äôs the only negative. We also had dinner there, and the food was very good and the chef  was very friendly. We‚Äôll stay again if we travel to Larnaca in the future. Negative: The location is a bit hard to find. The taxi drivers GPS had trouble finding it, but eventually we did. It‚Äôs amongst several apartment buildings on a small side street."

The rooms were completely renovated and stunning with brand new air conditioning systems that chilled the rooms within minutes (we rented a 2 bedroom suite). .

"Positive: We liked a lot the hotel, it's location and services. But the most we liked ‚Äî the personnel, especially the Chief. He is real professional, was always trying to prepare for us traditional vegan dishes of local cuisine (always delicious!). More over, he was very friendly and kind-hearted to us, recommending places of interest, routes e.t.c. Thanks to Cyprus, Thanks to La Veranda, thanks to the Chief!). Negative: It would be great to have a clothes dryer at the balcony or in the bathroom, because after the swimming nowhere to dry the wet clothes and towels. .  After the room cleaning, most hotels provide a bottle of water. It is not expensive for the hotel, but it is demonstrating the care about the clients. We had one bottle only after check in and none for the rest 5 nights."

Keep going guys and for sure is my favourite place for holidays. Negative: Nothing."
"Positive: New hotel  - so everything is modern and clean (and good bed linen, furniture). 5 minutes walk to Makkenzy beach (with planes landing just above you). Staff is very polite and friendly. 30 minutes walk to city center (10 minutes bus drive). Negative: The lock on the balcony's door was broken (however they sayd ""we repaired it"" when I asked it wasn't done, the lock wasn't closing as it should). I see it as a problem, cause with the door unlocked theoretically anyone could open the door from the balcony and the noise from the street was entering to my room through the ""crack"". I almost broke the showers door, cause when you open the shower the door touches the toilet."
"Positive: Nice  modern bedroom, nice greek breakfast and hotel great location, shame i only stayed one night. "
Positive: A wonderful place run by wonderful people. 
"Positive: This hotel was excellent and exceeded all my expectations. The restaurant had delicious food, the service was incredible, rooms were to a very high standard and clean. I am very pleased to stay here and grateful for the staff, they have been helpful, kind and professional. I highly recommend this hotel. "
"Positive: If I could give more than a rating of 10 I would. . The location is amazing. Being close to the airport in Larnaka makes travelling easier. Also being right next to the Salt Lake is a must-see especially if there is a good sunset. . Within a 10 minute walk you can be on MacKenzie beach which is well maintained and cleaner than other beaches we seen in Larnaka. Rebuke lounge at the beach is worth visiting for the quality of food and decor. . The hotel is next to a bus stop for travelling between downtown and other locations. Very handy since we didn‚Äôt hire a car. . The staff make this hotel great. They are friendly, warm, helpful. Always willing to do more to make the guest have a better stay. . The recently renovated room is about as clean as it could be. The facilities are modern and new. The shower is amazing for couples to use together. The balcony is a nice addition to an already fresh, well presented room. . The double bed is extremely comfortable and the new bedding was a delight. It is hard to get a comfortable sheet to sleep with in a country as warm as Cyprus but we were happy with everything offered by the hotel. . The minibar was extremely reasonably priced and well stocked. . Aircon perfect, easy to use. . Wifi great when we used it. . We didn‚Äôt take advantage of the pool in the hotel only because we ran out of time but on another trip we would have done so. . The front of the hotel is an extremely nice place to unwind in the evening. Negative: Minor point: a bar for hanging clothes in the room was the only thing we felt was missing to improve our stay."
Positive: perfect. 
"Positive: Superbly refurbished, with high-tech displays ‚Äúclean/DnD‚Äù outside. Negative: Taller people be careful of doorway leading to elevator - being 190 i head-bumped‚Ä¶."

"Positive: Close to airport - just 7-10 min by taxi (15‚Ç¨). Clean, fresh rooms with all you need for overnight stay. Very friendly staff. Negative: The bottle with hair/body wash was empty. Aircon had just one uncontrolled speed. There were no adapters for CY sockets. The blanket was too warm for summer night."
Positive: Very nice and kind stuff! Breakfast was tasty and excellent. 
"Positive: Everything. Very friendly and helpful staff, comfortable rooms, great location. Highly recommend. Negative: Nothing."
Positive: A LITTLE BIT FAR FROM SEA.

The staff made me feel welcome and was very helpful when asking about things to do. Definitely will be back. Negative: I wish I stayed longer."
"Positive: This hotel is very new and completely renovated. It‚Äôs spotless clean, comfortable and very good service from the family that owns it. We felt very welcome. The room is completely new and very clean. The mini bar was really well equipped and very cheap. Free parking, close to the city and very accessible by any transportation. "

Positive: Family room that fits a family of five. Fantastic breakfast. Close to jogging trails along the lake and close to the airport. Plus a super friendly staff. 
Positive: The room sizes were excellent for the wheelchair. The hotel was airy and light. The hotel was nice and very clean.  It was the reason why I booked (the reviews). It was great accessibility to where we wanted to be. Negative: The breakfast could have had more variety.  They had no cereal on offer at all.  They had no ordinary tea on offer.  It was al Earl Grey. No proper plan tea. This hotel is accessible to wheelchairs but there ramps are not to EU regulations.  VERY STEEP.  They really need to sort this.  The ramp right outside is very dangerous.  I am surprised I wasn't wheeled of this ramp.  I think booking.com should investigate this.
Positive: I Didn't eat at hotel .comfortable bed lovely soft duvet and pillows.good shower. Negative: 2 times noise in week 4 a.m from people picking rubbish into large lorries .
Positive: spotlessly clean and the staff were so helpful. Negative: it was not on the beach front as we were under the impression it was.
Positive: very clean. Negative: not enough pillows.
Positive: Quiet location. Negative: Bed was very soft and uncomfortable for me. Parking was very limited.
"Positive: Everything was pretty good, and as expected. Negative: Windows should be closed, as the front building looks right into your room."
Positive: The room was large and had a nice balcony. The bus stop into town was around the corner. Negative: There was nothing close by for a mini Mart. The restaurant was decent.
Positive: Clean and comfortable. Cute balconies. Short walk to Mckenzie beach. Negative: Street parking.
"Positive: I really liked how polite and friendly the staff was, and I also liked the size of the room an the bed. Negative: There are various things I would love to see improved, listed here:. - the shower of our room is very inconviniently placed, making a mess because of insufficient coverage of the bathroom glass. - the edges of the shower (between wall tiles and the shower floor) need replacement - they are hollow and seem moldy. - the bin is rusty. - the mirror is weirdly placed, on the right of the sink. - due to the placement of the curtains, a lot of light gets in the room in the morning. - there is no designated parking, you just park wherever you find. - we have requested late check out (1pm) which we got and we appreciate it. However, we got a call that prompted us to check out at the normal time (12pm) as the next customers would arrive. I exllained thay we have been granted late check out and the clerk apologised. No problem for this, but I find it important to keep staff updated about these things."
Positive: Near to the airport. Negative: There was some kind of unpleasant smell in the bathroom.
Positive: close to the airports. Negative: this is a guesthouse that is priced like a hotel.
"Positive: Maria and Richard are really great hosts! Very kind and hospitable. Maria has offered an adapter immediately. The room was perfectly clean. This is a good transitioning for one night, like I had. Or just to sleep over. Central location. Negative: Size of the room is one of the smallest I have ever seen. There is no space for the suitcase  nor a wardrobe. No sitting area. There is a terrace which Sun hits all the time, except for the early morning. For that money for which I used to pay better hotels in Valencia  you get one small water bottle."
"Positive: It was clean, the beds were comfortable. Negative: For what you get it was a bit expensive. The rooms were a bit small for a suite. No breakfast included. We tried it one time at their restaurant and it was low quality compared to an original greek breakfast. Didn't eat there again."
Positive: Very friendly people. Very spacious and clean room. Very close to the Larnaka airport as we needed it to be. Negative: The duvet was for the winter and even with 23 degrees Celsius on the a/c it was unbearable. No simple sheets on the bed either. Our only other choice was to close the a/c an go without covers but we could not open the windows because it was very very noisy. . Also the windows had no soundproofing whatsoever because the noise was too much. We gave the duvet a chance up to 3 am and then got up and opened the windows when the noise went down. We had to leave to catch a flight at 5am. Not a good night's sleep. Also the room had a hair dryer and a kettle that we could not use because the plugs did not fit the sockets and the hotel didn't provide adaptors. So no use of that service in the room either.
Positive: Usefully located hotel in between city centre and airport. Restaurant stayed open reasonably late so I could eat after an evening arrival in Cyprus. Negative: Restaurant was offering a rather narrow set of choices compared to what was listed on the menu. Room quite small.
"Positive: Friendly Staff. Very modern rooms. Negative: Bath room was cleaned rather superficially, so that medium nice with hair not being removed."
"Positive: Break fast was PERFECT, the room was PERFECT. Some issues with internet and location, bit far from the center, but very quite Area around. Negative: Cold floor in the room :-)."
Positive: Breakfast was very filling. It was located on the table in front of us (funny question). Negative: Room was a little cold. The hotel hadn‚Äôt yet opened up for the season. It was a little hard to find.
"Positive: clean room, friendly staff. Negative: off season, so no bar / restaurant/ pool, which was not clear on booking."
Positive: nice and very clean. Negative: that they couldn‚Äôt wait for 15min as i had just fractured my ankle and need to change my bandage and the Lady of the house was literally standing next to the door with a cleaner to clean the room. so i left without changing my bandage and had to do it outside on the street.
Positive: Nice clean little hotel next to the airport. Negative: Breakfast was below average.
"Positive: Location very good, didn't have breakfast but the evening meal was poor as it isn't really a bar or a restaurant. "
Positive: the staff were lovely. Negative: The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable and the telly was not working properly.
Positive: Clean room. Good location for makenzie beach. comfortable bed. Staff was excellent. Negative: Complimentary coffee/tea in our bedroom was not replenished after the first night. Only one coffee sachet for a double room. . Whatever was used from the fridge was also not replenished. There were no thin curtains to allow for some light to come through into the bedroom; and so you had to draw the thick curtains if you wanted privacy.
Positive: Close to the airport. Negative: We booked a taxi at 04:30 in the morning to go to the airport. Very frustrating that the host didnt inform us that his taxi had a double Booking instead of ordening another for us.
Positive: Friendly and Helpful Staff.  Room Cleanliness. 
"Positive: Property is perfectly located close from the airport and close to the famous Makenzie Beach. Neat and modern hotel facility. Negative: Property feels cold without an warm inviting atmosphere, as it‚Äôs to minimalistic. Rooms are a nice size but is unfortunately situated on top of the outside bar area. Twin beds are provided and the pillows is not comfortable at all. The shower in the bathroom is open in-front which results in the whole floor being wet. Property have a great potential with some care."
"Positive: Chose this hotel because of it‚Äôs proximity to airport. One nights stay straight from the flight before travelling onwards next morning to other areas. Easy to find (car hire) using Google maps. Friendly welcoming staff, easy check-in. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, COVID prevention measures taken. Never ate there, cold beers available (& needed) from bar downstairs or mini-bar in room. Very quiet neighbourhood - not sure what‚Äôs nearby etc as up & away early next morning. Would certainly recommend for this type of trip & will probably use again next time. Negative: Nothing to report."
"Positive: close to mackenzie beach. Negative: Safe didn‚Äôt work, back door balcony in other bedroom wouldn‚Äôt lock, do not disturb sign didn‚Äôt work (electronic) . asked for double bed and got two single beds next to eachother . very noisy guests. Waited 10 minutes for someone to come greet us for check in, no one on desk . Guy on desk told us we had not paid but we did . then he took a picture of my passport which no hotel does at all which was very strange ."
Negative: Very noisy neighborhood.
"Positive: It‚Äôs clean, you can easily pass here one night before flying back. Negative: The location was not great, the pool not even to be considered, the overall hotel installation is badly maintained. It‚Äôs in front of a pension and so close that people could see the colour of my underwear. . The aircon was too strong so we‚Äôd opened the windows, big mistake! Very noisy (I‚Äôve asked quiet room). The lift broke, the guy was offended becawe asked to see the room before paying‚Ä¶. The pictures of the room are accurate but fot the hotel installation and pool have a look to ‚ÄòPasithea Apartments‚Äô."
"Positive: -Location is good and rooms are very well maintained. Convenient by taxi to city Center,airport and beach. -Peaceful and good for couples and backpackers. -The sandwiches and hummus by the chef were delicious. üôÇ. - Mrs Tony does a fabulous job keeping the place spotless and making the guests comfortable. The helps are amazing too. Thanks to all at the hotel who work hard to keep it in good condition. Negative: -No free breakfast option. . -However when I booked this property in advance it was a higher price but booking.com reduced the price before my travel date and the hotel refused to accept the lower price which I felt was unfair for me as they charged twice for cancellation and rebooking. Maybe this was a booking.com issue or the hotel but I was quite unhappy about this since it was not justified by the owner. I spoke to Ali from booking.com and he said there was no cancellation charge but they charged me‚òπÔ∏è. -They need to put a lock to the bathroom and a shower glass door inside or else it gets messy. -wifi is not good."
Positive: I like the quietness and it‚Äôs close to airport. Negative: The way room are furnished is not comfortable.
"Positive: Basic night stay but facilities are limited. Negative: Noisy. Limited food options. Probably renovation work was in progress so, some items were not ready. Example, there is no rod for hangers in the wardrobe, the safe wasn‚Äôt fixed."
"Positive: Very comfortable bed, room very new and comfortable. Negative: TV did not work, garbage truck passes at 3 a.m with an incredible noise."
"Positive: Location was excellent and staff was very polite. Room was very clean upon arrival. Negative: Rate was very expensive for what it offered. No cleaning service the 4 days I stayed, no emptying garbage can and also had to ask for fresh towels. There were not even hangers for clothes in the closet."
"Positive: The people working there were kind and responsive. Negative: Our plumbing had complications twice.  Moreover, the cleaning crew cleaned out our rooms and threw out a box of cookies next to our bags that was meant to be a gift.  These cookies are only made in Thessaloniki and cost us 25 euros.  When we asked if they had seem them, the owners brought them out of the trash room and offered to spray them as if that would be acceptable for an edible gift during COVID pandemic cautions.  It was nice that they tried, but they should be refunding us for the cookies we lost.  I feel bad writing a negative review because they were kind; however, only things near the garbage should be thrown out.  Not stuff next to guests' belongings.  I was extremely disappointed in how they dealt with the situation, and that they thought it was acceptable to take an edible gift out of a trash room and continue as if nothing happened."
"Positive: excellent location, clean and modern. "
Positive: cleanliness. 
"Positive: The room was nice and clean, the two beds were set up as we requested. Negative: There wasn‚Äôt a fan in the bathroom so opening the window was required."

"Positive: Nice. Negative: The floor is not cleaned enough, full of dust, water does not drain and floods the room."
Positive: The hotel is located close to the airport (there is a bus with good frequency from the street next to the airport) and close to the city center. The hotel is located in a dead-end and quiet street - we had plenty of parking. The rooms were very clean. The staff at the hotel (Tony) was nice and gave a pleasant feeling - immediately after the booking we received a WhatsApp from him to confirm the time of arrival and to inform that they were waiting for us.

Positive: French speaking and competent staff. Negative: Nothing.
"Positive: The cleanest place I stayed in Cyprus. The staff is kind and welcoming. Negative: The Waze is to blame for what I didn't like. She was less helpful in guiding me than the locals, who explained to me in a second üôèüòä."
"Positive: pleasant accommodation, helpful reception, cleanliness. Negative: the rooms were not soundproofed enough."
"Positive: The staff are extremely friendly and always happy to help when needed. They were always ready to answer any of our questions. In a very good location, close to the airport, especially if you have an early or late flight, and also close to the beach. Negative: The main reason for not giving the highest rating is the noise. From the neighboring hotels/houses, they showered at any time of the day and made unpleasant noise. There were problems with the sealing and closing of the window."
"Positive: Nice room, very clean. Convenient because close to the airport. Very kind and helpful staff. We had dinner in the evening, it was very good. Negative: Just a bit far from town. Room a bit small."

"Positive: Practical rooms, balconies in each room. good location for the airport. Listening staff. Negative: The noise. The rooms are poorly soundproofed. We hear the neighbors moving."

Noisy, due to the heavy use of tiling and the steady stream of travelers arriving/departing for the airport throughout the night. Do not use this hotel other than for a stopover night near the airport."
Positive: wonderful hotel and staff! all as in the photo. 
"Positive: Very good accommodation in a perfect location, 7 minutes from the airport. "
"Positive: Great location. 10 minutes by bus from and to the airport. 10 minutes walk to the beach and cafes by the beach. It takes 40 minutes to walk along the promenade to the city, but it's nice. The hotel is good, the staff is friendly. "
"Positive: Great location close to the airport, friendly service and delicious breakfasts. "
"Positive: we only stayed at the LaVeranda Hotel for one night as the end of our Cyprus trip to be as close to the airport as possible for the last night! It was perfect for that. The room was very nicely furnished and, above all, super clean. The bus connection to the city center was just around the corner and we were able to get back to the hotel later in the evening without any problems using public transport. The location was also perfect for the trip to the airport the next morning (7:00 am). Mackenzie Beach is super close and so are lots of cool bars and restaurants. "
"Positive: Great welcome, very pleasant contact, very helpful. Negative: Access to the airport is close but not so easy with the bus, when you do not know."
Positive: everything is very good. 
"Positive: The accommodation itself is very good. It is very central. The problem is finding it. It is located in an alley and google maps went crazy. Now I understand why they sent me a photo of how to locate the street. Negative: Surely it's not a problem with the accommodation, but the guests in the upper apartment didn't stop making noise at 3am and on the other hand, if you go by car, even though there is an open-air car park very close, it's a real odyssey to be able to park. We had to leave the car far away."

We did not use the pool, the sea is better, because there is a good Mackenzie beach. And he did not have to swim. Negative: Of the minuses: sometimes a car came to pick up garbage cans at night.

The hosts are very friendly. Negative: Tomorrow is quite meager - 8 euros. The room is very very small (3 beds at 18 meters), but at the same time, clean and tidy.

The safe does not make sense since it is not walled, it does not matter if you leave the money in a bag. They could put shampoo in the bathroom, not just soap.
