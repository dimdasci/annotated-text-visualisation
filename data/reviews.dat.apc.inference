Excellent [ASP]service[ASP] .
It was a bit loud outside but that was just normal for summertime I guess .
[ASP]Shower[ASP] water often overflowed into the bathroom . [ASP]Drain[ASP] is not working well .
The [ASP]breakfast[ASP] offered by an independent service does not correspond quantitatively and qualitatively to the known levels of Cypriot [ASP]hospitality[ASP] and [ASP]gastronomy[ASP] ,   and [ASP]the[ASP] price of ‚Ç¨ 12 for breakfast is much more expensive than the [ASP]reasonable[ASP] value ( in terms of quality [ASP]and[ASP] quantity ) of the offered product !
Super clean , good [ASP]beds[ASP] .
I really liked how polite and friendly the [ASP]staff[ASP] was , and I also liked the size of the room an the bed
The [ASP]smell[ASP] in the [ASP]bathroom[ASP]
The hotel is 10 minutes from the airport which is very convenient for not missing your flight . The [ASP]welcome[ASP] was very warm and efficient . I unfortunately did not try the [ASP]breakfast[ASP] or other meal but the hotel is well located for the restaurants in the area .
very clean and the [ASP]staff[ASP] was wonderful
There was nothing not to like . Fabulous [ASP]place[ASP] .
Clean and good [ASP]communication[ASP] .
Fridge could have been put on beforehand so it was cold , the shower took a while to get hot , had to have a cold shower one morning as i needed to get out early . When you left it running for around 5 mins it got warm and was a good shower . Ordered pizza one night and was not great , too stodgy but I ' m sure other food is better . The restaurant area is nice and the staff very accomodating .
Very nice [ASP]owner[ASP] , great hotel , close to the beach ! !
Refurbishment not totally complete , so [ASP]safety box[ASP] box wasn ‚Äô t working . Our room was a family suite ( for 4 people ) , so could do with one more double hook in [ASP]bathroom[ASP] for [ASP]towels[ASP] .
My stay at this hotel was a great experience and would definitely come back with my family ! The staff was so helpful , friendly and welcoming . My one night stay felt like home ! Great location very close to the airport , 1 minute walk to the bus station , beach and restaurants . The room was very clean and spacious . The mini bar was rich and very well priced , even breakfast was presentable and tasty ! Highly recommended !
[ASP]Location[ASP] and [ASP]staff[ASP] The [ASP]food[ASP] was amazing at the restaurant
This was only a one night stay before moving onto our holiday accommodation for the rest of the week . We arrived later than planned due to flight issues but the owner was aware as he had tracked our flight ; despite being late we were offered food and drink in the bar which was most welcome . The room was clean and an adequate size with a nice balcony . Breakfast was outstanding . The staff were all friendly and welcoming - especially the restaurant owner .
Lovely and clean room , enough for a family with 3 children . Two rooms . The children ' s third bed was a bit problematic and not very stable . The location near the airport is convenient for those who need to fly early in the morning . There is also a shuttle to the field . There is a lovely promenade on the sea ( McKenzie Beach ) with worthwhile restaurants - very worth going in the evening . The staff is charming and kind , answers with a smile and agrees to every request . The restaurant in the hotel is also great .
friendly [ASP]staff[ASP]
On the 4th floor with all the [ASP]windows[ASP] and [ASP]balcony doors[ASP] doors locked we could still hear some outside noise .
Very clean , very comfortable [ASP]room[ASP] . [ASP]Staff[ASP] was extremely helpful . They ordered a taxi for us to get to the airport very early in the morning . We were able to enjoy a very nice , short walk to the beach where there were many restaurants available to choose from . We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Larnaca .
Its was a nice [ASP]place[ASP] clean and the [ASP]room[ASP] was nice
Clean and spacious [ASP]room[ASP]
[ASP]Location[ASP] is very close to the beach , very kind [ASP]staff[ASP] on the last day kept our suitcases in custody for the whole day . Very close to the airport , like 8 minutes by car . Really soft [ASP]bed[ASP] and [ASP]pillows[ASP]
Booked this as it was near the airport and we arrived at 11pm and didn ‚Äô t seem worth paying for one night at the 5 star we stayed at for the rest of the holiday .   Very [ASP]warm[ASP] welcome and very clean and comfortable - as good a hotel as I ‚Äô ve stayed at for ¬£ 50 a night .
A modern , clean , friendly and all you need for a great Holiday .
Too bad the [ASP]swimming pool[ASP] pool is not indicated on the booking site and at the [ASP]reception[ASP] of the hotel !
The [ASP]electric kettle[ASP] kettle didn ' t seem to work . ( But that ' s a detail ! ) .

We stayed 1 week and enjoyed it very much . The rooms are lovely and new , very clean and comfortable . The mattress was to my taste .

We would definitely stay again on our next visit to Larnaca . Thank you so much for the great time we had with you .

The gentleman in reception was very friendly and had a lovely smile . The place was spotless and very comfortable . I would definitely recommend it and will be staying here again . The fish and steak restaurant around the corner was also great value and friendly .
[ASP]location[ASP] is good you can take bus 425 from the airport to somewhere close enough to the hotel . stuff were super nice ! [ASP]room[ASP] is spacious and clean , [ASP]bed[ASP] is comfy too .
The [ASP]breakfast[ASP] is delicious but the same . Eat what they bring you . A fruit van drove under the windows almost every day from early morning and the seller shouted into the mouthpiece . Walking distance to the center , but within walking distance of Mackenzie beach and all party cafes . Poor [ASP]soundproofing[ASP] from corridor .
Super clean , close to the beach and great restaurants , the [ASP]staff[ASP] is exceptionally nice , next time we will come for more than one night !

There was nothing that we didn ' t like
The place is close to the airport and easy to get to . We arrived late and the [ASP]directions[ASP] were clear and easy . The [ASP]place[ASP] is clean and everything was exactly as expected A short distance from the promenade where you can find nice restaurants on the beach
Really clean , lovely caring [ASP]staff[ASP] . [ASP]food[ASP] was good too !
Nothing to complain .
We had ordered a shuttle and thought it was specific to the hotel but it turned out to be just a lambda taxi , the problem is that we waited for it for 40 minutes because it was late but nobody warned us . We had to pay it straight away when we thought it would be included in the hotel bill at the end of the stay . It would be better to indicate directly that it is independent of the hotel , we would not have waited in front of other taxis and tried to reach everyone . . .
There was some kind of unpleasant smell in the [ASP]bathroom[ASP]
Super clean modern room and [ASP]bathroom[ASP] with balcony . Wonderful [ASP]air conditioning[ASP] conditioning that also stays on when you leave the room or open the balcony door .
Very nice and clean [ASP]room[ASP] .

Our stay was just about perfect . This is one of the most impressive stays we ever had with a Booking . Com reservation . The location allowed us to walk to the beach and restaurants . The family that runs the hotel was incredibly friendly and very , very nice . The rooms , lobby and restaurant were lovely ; exceedlingly modern , and comfortable . We ate dinner at the hotel because we were so impressed with " chef Richard " and the food was fabulous . Were had cocktails on the lovely patio and had the chance to meet and chat with other guests .
We didn ' t eat
My [ASP]stay[ASP] was fantastic , steps to Makenzy beach , caf√©s , and restaurants . Easy access to nightlife . The [ASP]building[ASP] is very clean and made for a comfortable stay . The [ASP]staff[ASP] made me feel welcome and was very helpful when asking about things to do . Definitely will be back !
Cozy hotel in a quiet location . Walking distance to the beach , we went with a child . Walking around is also interesting . The room is very clean , comfortable mattresses , excellent clean bedding . There is only soap in the shower , no shower gel . Keep in mind . But we usually go with ours . Very polite and pleasant staff . We took breakfast once . I liked it .
Great [ASP]location[ASP] close to the airport , friendly [ASP]service[ASP] and delicious [ASP]breakfasts[ASP] .
