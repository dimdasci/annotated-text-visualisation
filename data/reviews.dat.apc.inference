close to the airports
[ASP]location[ASP] is good you can take bus 425 from the airport to somewhere close enough to the hotel . stuff were super nice ! [ASP]room[ASP] is spacious and clean , [ASP]bed[ASP] is comfy too .
La Veranda was very clean , provided everything needed ( even a bottle of water in the room ! ) , and was flexible with our schedule . The [ASP]staff[ASP] was excellent . There are a series of delicious and fun restaurants on the beach quite close to the hotel , which the [ASP]staff[ASP] of the hotel kindly told us about .
Practical [ASP]rooms[ASP] , balconies in each room . good [ASP]location[ASP] for the airport . Listening [ASP]staff[ASP] .
I liked the hotel already when approaching it from the street . The feeling of the new did not leave all the time . Starting from the street terrace , the hall and up to the room itself - clean , comfortable , with a soft bed . As it turned out later , the hotel is already about 8 years old , but they are doing well üëç Always friendly staff ( it looks like a family business , but I will not say ) . Every day cleaning . At any time , you can go down to the veranda at the tables and just drink their wonderful cappuccino on soft sofas , and then sleep the rest of the night on soft beds . We did not use the pool , the sea is better , because there is a good Mackenzie beach . And he did not have to swim .
The [ASP]staff[ASP] is very friendly

The room was super clean , everything new and cosy , the bathroom with a spacious cabin shower . The bed and pillows were very comfy . The staff was super super friendly and made everything possible for our stay to be perfect . Rich breakfast with various local food . Also we ate dinner a couple of times at the terrace and everything was very tasty . We have absolutely nothing to complain , it was a dreamy vacation and for sure we will come back .

The [ASP]rooms[ASP] and and the [ASP]staff[ASP]
Chose this hotel because of it ‚Äô s proximity to airport . One nights stay straight from the flight before travelling onwards next morning to other areas . Easy to find ( car hire ) using Google maps . Friendly welcoming staff , easy check - in . The hotel itself is spotlessly clean , COVID prevention measures taken . Never ate there , cold beers available ( & needed ) from bar downstairs or mini - bar in room . Very quiet neighbourhood - not sure what ‚Äô s nearby etc as up & away early next morning . Would certainly recommend for this type of trip & will probably use again next time .
We only stayed over night before heading to the airport . The [ASP]room[ASP] was exceptionally clean with a really comfortable [ASP]bed[ASP]
Minor point : a [ASP]bar[ASP] for hanging clothes in the [ASP]room[ASP] was the only thing we felt was missing to improve our stay .
The " street side " [ASP]rooms[ASP] are noisier than those facing the back .
It was cold for a [ASP]swim[ASP] : )
Nothing . It was perfect
We lived for a week 1 . Bed linen was never changed ( cleaning and change of towels daily ) ; 2 . the number is microscopic . Rented Nissan Micra and then more ; 3 . the refrigerator is full of minibar for money , I had to pull everything out so that my products would fit ; 4 . the hotel did not allow to turn over a couple of hours before the delayed plane ; 5 . walk to the promenade of Larnaca for about 20 minutes , to Lidl for an hour and a half . The hotel is really for one night .
There was nothing close by for a mini Mart . The [ASP]restaurant[ASP] was decent .
I can ' t even remember .
not enough [ASP]pillows[ASP]
Good [ASP]hotel[ASP] next to Mackenzie [ASP]beach[ASP] and especially the airport . It is 5 minutes by car
[ASP]Everything[ASP] was excellent
very close to the airport after a late flight , lovely friendly [ASP]staff[ASP] who checked us in quickly and beautiful , spotless [ASP]room[ASP] . really comfortable nights sleep in an air conditioned room after a great shower . beautiful fresh [ASP]breakfast[ASP] which was very reasonably [ASP]priced[ASP] . also stored luggage and called a taxi for us .
[ASP]breakfasts[ASP] . This is probably the weakest link in the hotel .
Small beautiful clean [ASP]room[ASP] . They accommodated us with an earlier check - in and earlier check - out . There is no problem with a later check - in either . We had a small [ASP]lunch[ASP] here and it was delicious . [ASP]Staff[ASP] very nice . A short distance from the beach , we also found starfish . The hotel arranged a transfer to the airport for us .
The warm [ASP]welcome[ASP] in French , the comfort of the [ASP]beds[ASP] , the cleanliness .

The frozen [ASP]water[ASP] in the [ASP]bath[ASP]
Not too close to the [ASP]beach[ASP] Perfect for pre or post airport stays
Everything was wonderful ! ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ
Of the minuses : sometimes a car came to pick up garbage cans at night . More precisely , the car poured them into its depths , not worrying about the noise and sleeping expensive tourists . Also [ASP]mirrors[ASP] in the room . There are plenty of them and they all distorted the image . rather made you fatter ) ) Everything else is a plus !
[ASP]Outside[ASP] was a but noisy later in the evening , but that ' s not within the hotels control
That there is no [ASP]kiosk[ASP] open 24 hours close to the hotel .
Small , modern hotel with very friendly and helpful [ASP]hosts[ASP] . 30 minute walk from Larnaca center and 10 minute walk from beautiful Mackenzie [ASP]Beach[ASP] ! I ' d love to come back !

Very clean , nice [ASP]bed[ASP] and [ASP]linen[ASP] . Good [ASP]value[ASP] . Allowed to take dog was the reason for booking .
The location was perfect for the airport as we were flying out to uk . The entrance to the hotel is welcoming and the bar and coffee shop chic . The gentleman in reception was very friendly and had a lovely smile . The place was spotless and very comfortable . I would definitely recommend it and will be staying here again . The fish and steak restaurant around the corner was also great value and friendly .
Recently updated , everything was me and clean . Restaurant was a surprise hit : good [ASP]food[ASP] , very reasonably [ASP]priced[ASP] , so an easy choice to eat at the hotel when we wouldn ' t usually . The beach is about 5 minutes walk away .
It ' s my second time at La [ASP]Veranda[ASP] and I can honestly say that this is one of the best hotels in the region , if not the best . Would definitely recommend it !

Excellent [ASP]location[ASP] , perfect [ASP]cleanliness[ASP] , excellent [ASP]breakfasts[ASP] for only 8 ‚Ç¨ , super [ASP]service[ASP]
Except excellent staff / owners and an ok restaurant , there is not much extra in this hotel or in the room .   Tips for improvement :   - The out - of - order pool table hidden away in the backyard should be brought back to life .   - The backyard itself could actually have been used so much better .   - The small fridge in the room was warm ( turned off ) upon arrival and completely empty , and no local shop / kiosk nearby to fill it up . One small bottle of water upon arrival to double room feels a little poor . Would gladly have paid those 2 ‚Ç¨ more per day to have 2 bottles initially and being refilled daily with room service . A couple of cents more , to have even tea on the small welcome tray ; - )   - Bathroom floor gets completely wet when ( carefully ) showering , as only half a glass wall covers the shower .   - Bed frame has very sharp / hard corners , and it ' s easy to get hurt . Apply baby safety corners ?   - Veranda door and main door doesn ' t close entirely tight so main door slams in the night when it ' s windy . However fixable in MacGyver way using the bed cover and a tea spoon , although a professional seal attached to the door frame would probably be a better fix long - term ; - )   - Beach towel services would also have been nice and useful , to avoid using lots of space / weight in baggage .   All in all , this hotel is great but still has room for improvement in many little details which could easily be fixed . Still getting our high rating as the staff is simply the best and made our stay a true pleasure , thus above comments should not scare anyone from booking this hotel . We highly recommend it and would definitely love to return !
Amazing [ASP]place[ASP] !
Bright , cozy , looks like almost new hotel in silent part of town . Very helpful [ASP]staff[ASP] . 15 minutes drive from the airport , 15 walk to the city center , about 300 meters to the nice beach .
The restaurant [ASP]service[ASP] is very good , varied and with good [ASP]prices[ASP] , the [ASP]workers[ASP] are very pleasant and attentive .
The [ASP]hotel[ASP] is close to Larnaca Airport and the [ASP]beach[ASP] . For the best .
A very welcoming [ASP]staff[ASP] , smiling and always available to satisfy you . At the [ASP]reception[ASP] as in the restaurant there is always someone to take care of you in one of the four languages ‚Äã ‚Äã ( Greek , English , French or Arabic ) . The proximity to the famous Mackenzie Beach is an asset for this charming hotel . The beach is around 5 minutes walk . . .
