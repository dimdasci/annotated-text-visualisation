I really like how thick the jacket is. I wear a large jacket because I have broad shoulders and that’s what I ordered and it fits perfectly there. I almost feel like it balloons out from the chest down. I thought I would use the strings in the bottom of the jacket to help close it and bring it in, but those don’t work. The jacket feels very bulky.
